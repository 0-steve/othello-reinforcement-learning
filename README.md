# othello-reinforcement-learning

Play the game of Othello using AlphaZero reinforcement learning algorithm. AlphaZero utlizes a Monte Carlo Tree Search to self learn the best possible move from a given state. The Monte Carlo Tree Search allows for AlphaZero to run simulations from a given state to look ahead and see what the outcome will take place from a given move. 

In this project, the game at hand is Othello, a strategic board game with the goal to have the majoroty of the board covered by your colored piece by the end of the game. The project will train and test a neural network that plays against itself and determines its win percentage. Explore the code, especially the loss function in the Jupyter Notebook, and see what changes can be made to improve the win percentage.
